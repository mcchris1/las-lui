How would you test an ATM in a distributed banking system?

Hints:
#210: Be careful about your assumptions. Who are the users? Where are they using this? It might seem obvious, but the real answer might be different.
#225: In a real interview, you would also want to discuss what sorts of test tools we have available.
#268: What are the different features and uses we would want to test?
#349: What can we automate?
#393: Have you thought about security and reliability?
