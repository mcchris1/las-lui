How would you test a pen?

Hints:
#140: What does the interviewer mean by a pen? There are a lot of different types of pens. Make a list of potential questions you would want to ask.
#164: Consider the scenario of a pen for children. What does this mean? What are the different use cases?
#220: Have you considered both intended uses (writing, etc.) and unintended use? What about safety? You would not want a pen for children to be dangerous.
