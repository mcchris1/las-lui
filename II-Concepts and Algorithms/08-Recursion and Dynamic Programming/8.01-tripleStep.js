/*
A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs. 

Hints:
#152: Approach this from the top down. What is the very last hop the child made?
#178: If we knew the number of paths to each of the steps before step 100, could we compute the number of steps to 100?
#217: We can compute the number of steps to 100 by the number of steps to 99, 98, and 97. This corresponds to the child hopping 1, 2, or 3 steps at the end. Do we add those or multiply them? That is: Is it f(100) = f(99) + f(98) + f(97) 𝑜𝑟 f(100) = f(99) * f(98) * f(97)?
#237: We multiply the values when it's "we do this then this." We add them when it's "we do this or this."
#262: What is the runtime of this method? Think carefully. Can you optimize it?
#359: Try memoization as a way to optimize an inefficient recursive program.
