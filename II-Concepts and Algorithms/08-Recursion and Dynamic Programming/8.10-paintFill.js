/*
Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing programs. That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point, and a new color, fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color.

Hints:
#364: Think about this as a graph.
#382: You can implement this using depth-first search (or breadth-first search). Each adjacent pixel of the "right" color is a connected edge.
