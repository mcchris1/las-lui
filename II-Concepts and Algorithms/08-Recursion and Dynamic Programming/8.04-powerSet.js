/*
Write a method to return all subsets of a set.

Hints:
#273: How can you build all subsets of {a, b, c} from the subsets of {a, b}?
#290: Anything that is a subset of {a, b} is also a subset of {a, b, c}. Which sets are subsets of {a, b, c} but not {a, b}?
#338: Subsets that contain c will be subsets {a, b, c} but not {a, b}. Can you build these subsets from the subsets of {a, b}?
#354: You can build the remaining subsets by adding c to all the subsets of {a, b}.
#373: You can also do this by mapping each subset to a binary number. The ith bit could represent a "boolean" flag for whether an element is in the set.
