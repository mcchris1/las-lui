/*
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

Hints:
#331: For the robot to reach the last cell, it must find a path to the second-to-last cells. For it to find a path to the second-to-last cells, it must find a path to the third-to-last cells.
#360: Simplify this problem a bit by first figuring out if there's a path. Then, modify your algorithm to track the path.
#388: Think again about the efficiency of your algorithm. Can you optimize it?
