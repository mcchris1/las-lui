/*
Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.

EXAMPLE
Input:  29 (or: 11101), 15 (or: 01111)
Output: 2

Hints:
#336: How would you figure out how many bits are different between two numbers?
#369: Think about what an XOR indicates. If you do a XOR b, where does the result have 1s? Where does it have 0s?
