/*
Design a system like Pastebin, where a user can enter a piece of text and get a randomly generated URL to access it. 

Hints:
#165: Scope the problem well. What will and won't you tackle as part of this system?
#184: How evenly do you think traffic is distributed? Do all documents get roughly the same age of traffic? Or is it likely there are some very popular documents?
#206: How will you handle generating URLs?
#232: If you generate URLs randomly, do you need to worry about collisions (two documents with the same URL)? If so, how can you handle this?
