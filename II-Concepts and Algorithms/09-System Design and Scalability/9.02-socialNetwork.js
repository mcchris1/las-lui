/*
How would you design the data structures for a very large social network like Facebook or LinkedIn? Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the shortest path between two people (e.g., Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason -> You).

Hints:
#270: To find the connection between two nodes, would it be better to do a breadth-first search or depth-first search? Why?
#285: A breadth-first search is probably better. A depth-first search can wind up going on a long path, even though the shortest path is actually very short. Is there a modification to a breadth-first search that might be even faster?
#304: Is there any way to search from both the source and destination? For what reason or in what case might this be faster?
#321: Discuss how you might implement these algorithms and this system in the real world. What sort of optimizations might you make?
