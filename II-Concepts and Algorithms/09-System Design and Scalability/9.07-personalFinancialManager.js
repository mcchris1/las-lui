/*
Explain how you would design a personal financial manager (like Mint.com). This system would connect to your bank accounts, analyze your spending habits, and make recommendations. 

Hints:
#162: Will this application be write-heavy or read-heavy?
#180: Observe that there is a lot of data coming in, but people probably aren't reading the data very frequently.
#199: The system will be write-heavy: Lots of data being imported, but it's rarely being read.
#212: Think about things like how you're going to get the bank data (will it be pulled or pushed?), what features the system will support, etc.
#247: Try to reduce unnecessary database queries. If you don't need to permanently store the data in the database, you might not need it in the database at all.
#276: As much work as possible should be done asynchronously.
