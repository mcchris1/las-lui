/*
Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n-1)) == 0).

Hints:
#151: Reverse engineer this, starting from the outermost layer to the innermost layer.
#202: What does it mean if A & B == 0?
#261: If A & B == 0, then it means that A and B never have a 1 at the same spot. Apply this to the equation in the problem.
#302: If (n & (n-1)) == 0, then this means that n and n - 1 never have a 1 in the same spot. Why would that happen?
#346: What is the relationship between how n looks and how n - 1 looks? Walk through a binary subtraction.
#372: When you do a binary subtraction, you flip the rightmost 0s to a 1, stopping when you get to a 1 (which is also flipped). Everything (all the 1s and 0s) on the left will stay put.
#383: Picture n and n-1. To subtract 1 from n, you flipped the rightmost 1 to a 0 and all the 0s on its right to 1s. If n & n-1 == 0, then there are no 1s to the left of the first 1. What does that mean about n?
#398: We know that n must have only one 1 if n & (n-1) == 0. What sorts of numbers have only one 1?
