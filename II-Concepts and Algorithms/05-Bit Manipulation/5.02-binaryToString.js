/*
Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR."

Hints:
#143: To wrap your head around the problem, try thinking about how you'd do it for integers.
#167: In a number like .893 (in base 10), what does each digit signify? What then does each digit in .10010 signify in base 2?
#173: A number such as .893 (in base 10) indicates 8 * 10⁻¹ + 9 * 10⁻² + 3 * 10⁻³. Translate this system into base 2.
#269: How would you get the first digit in .893? If you multiplied by 10, you'd shift the values over to get 8.93. What happens if you multiply by 2?
#297: Think about what happens for values that can't be represented accurately in binary.
