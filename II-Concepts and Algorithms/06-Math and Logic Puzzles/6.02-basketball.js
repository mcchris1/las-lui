You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.

Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.

If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

Hints:
#181: Calculate the probability of winning the first game and winning the second game, then compare them.
#239: To calculate the probability of winning the second game, start with calculating the probability of making the first hoop, the second hoop, and not the third hoop.
#284: If two events are mutually exclusive (they can never occur simultaneously), you can add their probabilities together. Can you find a set of mutually exclusive events that represent making two out of three hoops?
#323: The probability of making two out of three shots is probability(make shot 1, miss shot 2, make shot 3) + probability(miss shot 1, make shot 2, make shot 3) + probability(make shot 1, make shot 2, make shot 3).
