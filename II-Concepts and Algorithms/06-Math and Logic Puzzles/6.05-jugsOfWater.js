/*
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Hints:
#149: Play around with the jugs of water, pouring water back and forth, and see if you can measure anything other than 3 quarts or 5 quarts. That's a start.
#379: If you fill the 5-quart jug and then use it to fill the 3-quart, you'll have two quarts left in the 5-quart jug. You can either keep those two quarts where they are, or you can dump the contents of the smaller jug and pour the two quarts in there.
#400: Once you've developed a way to solve this problem, think about it more broadly. If you are given a jug of size X and another jug of size Y, can you always use it to measure Z?
