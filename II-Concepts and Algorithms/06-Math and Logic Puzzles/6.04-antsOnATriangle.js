There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed. 

Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

Hints:
#157: In what cases will they not collide?
#195: The only way they won't collide is if all three are walking in the same direction. What's the probability of all three walking clockwise?
#296: You can think about this either as the probability(3 ants walking clockwise) + probability(3 ants walking counter-clockwise). Or, you can think about it as: The first ant picks a direction. What's the probability of the other ants picking the same direction?
