/*
Implement an NxN jigsaw puzzle. Design the data structures and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle. You can assume that you have a fitsWith method which, when passed two puzzle edges, returns true if the two edges belong together.

Hints:
#192: A common trick when solving a jigsaw puzzle is to separate edge and non-edge pieces. How will you represent this in an object-oriented manner?
#238: Think about how you might record the position of a piece when you find it. Should it be stored by row and location?
#283: Which will be the easiest pieces to match first? Can you start with those? Which will be the next easiest, once you've nailed those down?
