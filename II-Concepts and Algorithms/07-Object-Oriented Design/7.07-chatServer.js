Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details about the various backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problems to solve?

Hints:
#213: As always, scope the problem. Are "friendships" mutual? Do status messages exist? Do you support group chat?
#245: This is a good problem to think about the major system components or technologies that would be useful.
#271: How will you know if a user signs offline?
