/*
Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is the classic single-player computer game where an NxN grid has B mines (or bombs) hidden across the grid. The remaining cells are either blank or have a number behind them. The numbers reflect the number of bombs in the surrounding eight cells. The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to and including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed. The player wins when all non-bomb cells are exposed. The player can also flag certain places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game play, other than to block the user from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought to have a bomb. (Tip for the reader: if you're not familiar with this game, please play a few rounds online first.)

Hints:
#351: Should number cells, blank cells, and bomb cells be separate classes?
#361: What is the algorithm to place the bombs around the board?
#377: To place the bombs randomly on the board: Think about the algorithm to shuffle a deck of cards. Can you apply a similar technique?
#386: How do you count the number of bombs neighboring a cell? Will you iterate through all cells?
#399: When you click on a blank cell, what is the algorithm to expand the neighboring cells?
