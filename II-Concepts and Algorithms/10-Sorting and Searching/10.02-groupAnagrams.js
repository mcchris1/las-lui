/*
Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other. 

Hints:
#177: How do you check if two words are anagrams of each other? Think about what the definition of "anagram" is. Explain it in your own words.
#182: Two words are anagrams if they contain the same characters but in different orders. How can you put characters in order?
#263: Can you leverage a standard sorting algorithm?
#342: Do you even need to truly "sort"? Or is just reorganizing the list sufficient?
