/*
Write an aligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory such that the memory address returned is divisible by a specific power of two.

EXAMPLE
align_malloc(1000,128) will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128 and that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.
aligned_free() will free memory allocated by align_malloc.

Hints:
#413: Typically, malloc will just give us an arbitrary block of memory. If we can't override this behavior, can we work with it to do what we need?
#432: Imagine we have a sequential set of integers (3, 4, 5, ...). How big does this set need to be to ensure that one of the numbers is divisible by 16?
#440: How will we free the memory?
