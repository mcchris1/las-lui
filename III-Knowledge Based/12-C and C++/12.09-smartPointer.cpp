/*
Write a smart pointer class. A smart pointer is a data type, usually implemented with templates, that simulates a pointer while also providing automatic garbage collection. It automatically counts the number of references to a SmartPointer<T*> object and frees the object of type T when the reference count hits zero.

Hints:
#402: Focus on the concept firsts, then worry about the exact implementation. How should SmartPointer look?
#438: Think about tracking the number of references. What will this tell us?
#453: What are all the different methods/operators we might want to override?
