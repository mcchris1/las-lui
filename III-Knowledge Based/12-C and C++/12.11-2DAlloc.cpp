/*
Write a function in C called my2DAlloc which allocates a two-dimension array. Minimize the number of calls to malloc and make sure that the memory is accessible by the notation arr[i][j].

Hints:
#406: Recall that a two dimensional array is essentially an array of arrays.
#418: One approach is to call malloc for each array. How would we free the memory here?
#426: Can we allocate this instead as a contiguous block of memory?
