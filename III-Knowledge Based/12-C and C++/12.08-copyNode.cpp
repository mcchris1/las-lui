/*
Write a method that takes a pointer to a Node structure as a parameter and returns a complete copy of the passed in data structure. The Node data structure contains two pointers to other Nodes. 

Hints:
#427: This data structure can be pictured as a binary tree, but it's not necessarily. What if there's a loop in the structure?
#462: Consider using a hash table.
