You are given a class with synchronized method A and a normal method B. If you have two threads in one instance of a program, can they both execute A at the same time? Can they execute A and B at the same time?

Hints:
#429: The keyword synchronized ensures that two threads cannot execute synchronized methods on the same instance at the same time.
