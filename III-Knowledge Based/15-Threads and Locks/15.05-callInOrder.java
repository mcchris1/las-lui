/*
Suppose we have the following code:

public class Foo {
    public Foo() { ... }
    public void first() { ... }
    public void second() { ... }
    public void third() { ... }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. ThreadA will call first, threadB will call second, and threadC will call third. Design a mechanism to ensure that first is called before second and second is called before third. 

Hints:
#417: How can we ensure that first() has terminated before calling second()?
#433: Why would using boolean flags to do this be a bad idea?
#446: Would semaphores be useful here?
