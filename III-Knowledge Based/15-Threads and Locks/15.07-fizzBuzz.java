/*
In the classic problem FizzBuzz, you are told to print the numbers from 1 to n. However, when th enumber is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". When it is divisible by 5, print "Buzz". When it is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". In this problem, you are asked to do this in a multithreaded way. Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads. One thread checks for divisibility of 3 and prints "Fizz". Another thread is responsible for divisibility of 5 and prints "Buzz". A third thread is responsible for divisibility of 3 and 5 and prints "FizzBuzz". A fourth thread does the numbers. 

Hints:
#414: First implement the single-threaded FizzBuzz problem.
#439: Don't try to do anything fancy on the single-threaded problem. Just get something that is simple and easily readable.
#447: Outline the structure for the threads without worrying about synchronizing anything.
#458: Once you get the structure of each thread done, think about what you need to synchronize.
