/*
In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are sitting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the left chopstick before the right one. A deadlock could potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using threads and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that prevents deadlocks.

Hints:
#419: A deadlock can happen when there's a "cycle" in the order of who is waiting for whom. How can we break or prevent this cycle?
#437: One idea is to just not let a philosopher hold onto a chopstick if he can't get the other one.
