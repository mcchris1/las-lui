/*
Explain the differences between TreeMap, Hashmap, and LinkedHashMap. Provide an example of when each one would be best. 

Hints:
#420: Think about the underlying data structure.
#424: HashMap uses an array of linked lists. TreeMap uses a red-black tree. LinkedHashMap uses doubly-linked buckets. What is the implication of this?
#430: Consider how they might differ in terms of the order of iteration through the keys. Why might you want one option instead of the others?
#454: What would the runtime of the common operations be?
