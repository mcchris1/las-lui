/*
Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffle——in other words, each of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume that you are given a random number generator which is perfect.

Hints:
#483: Try approaching this problem recursively.
#579: Suppose you had a method shuffle that worked on decks up to n - 1 elements. Could you use this method to implement a new shuffle method that works on decks up to n elements?
#634: You could build this algorithm recursively by swapping the nth element for any of the elements before it. What would this look like iteratively?
