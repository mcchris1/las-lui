/*
You are given two arrays, one shorter (with all distinct elements) and one longer. Find the shortest subarray in the longer array that contains all the elements in the shorter array. The items can appear in any order.

EXAMPLE
Input:  {1, 5, 9} | {7, 5, 9, 0, 2, 1, 3, *5, 7, 9, 1*, 1, 5, 8, 8, 9, 7}
Output: [7, 10] (the *underlined portion* above)

Hints:
#645: Start with a brute force solution.
#652: One brute force solution is to take each starting position and move forward until you've found a subsequence which contains all the target characters.
#669: Another way of thinking about the brute force is that we take each starting index and find the next instance of each element in the target string. The maximum of all these next instances marks the end of a subsequence which contains all the target characters. What is the runtime of this? How can we make it faster?
#681: Consider the previously explained brute force solution. A bottleneck is repeatedly asking for the next instance of a particular character. Is there a way you can optimize this? You should be able to do this in O(1) time.
#691: Can you precompute the next instance of a particular character from each index? Try using a multi-dimensional array. 
#725: Once you have the precomputation solution figured out, think about how you can reduce the space complexity. You should be able to get it down to O(SB) time and O(B) space (where B is the size of the larger array and S is the size of the smaller array).
#731: Another way to think about it is this: Imagine you had a list of the indices where each item appeared. Could you find the first possible subsequence with all the elements? Could you find the second?
#741: Consider using a heap.
