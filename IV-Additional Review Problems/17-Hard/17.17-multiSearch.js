/*
Given a string b and an array of smaller strings T, design a method to search b for each small string in T.

Hints:
#480: Start with a brute force solution. What is the runtime?
#582: Can you use a trie?
#617: One solution is to insert every suffix of the larger string into the trie. For example, if the word is dogs, the suffixes would be dogs, ogs, gs, and s. How would this help you solve the problem? What is the runtime here?
#743: Alternatively, you could insert each of the smaller strings into the trie. How would this help you solve the problem? What is the runtime?
