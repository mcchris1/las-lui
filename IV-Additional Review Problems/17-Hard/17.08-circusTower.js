A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one another's shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number of people in such a tower. 

EXAMPLE
Input:  (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom: (56, 90) (60, 95) (65, 100) (68, 110) (70, 150) (75, 190)

Hints:
#638: This problem asks us to find the longest sequence of pairs you can build such that both sides of the pair are constantly increasing. What if you needed only one side of the pair to increase?
#657: If you needed only one side of the pair to increase, then you would just sort all the values on that side. Your longest sequence would in fact be all the pairs (other than any duplicates, since the longest sequence needs to strictly increase). What does this tell you about the original problem?
#666: If you sort the values based on height, then this will tell you the ordering of the final pairs. The longest sequence must be in this relative order (but not necessarily containing all of the pairs). You now just need to find the longest increasing subsequence on weight while keeping the items in the same relative order. This is essentially the same problem as having an array of integers and trying to find the longest sequence you can build (without reordering those items).
#682: Try a recursive approach that just evaluates all possibilities.
#699: Another way to think about the problem is this: if you had the longest sequence ending at each element A[0] through A[n-1], could you use that to find the longest sequence ending at element A[n-1]?
