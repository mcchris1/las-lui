/*
Write a method to randomly generate a set of m integers from an array of size n. Each element must have equal probability of being chosen.

Hints:
#494: If you haven't already, solve 17.2.
#596: Try this recursively. Suppose you had an algorithm to get a subset of size m from n-1 elements. Could you develop an algorithm to get a subset of size m from n elements?
