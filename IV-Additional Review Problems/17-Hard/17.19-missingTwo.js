/*
You are given an array with all the numbers from 1 to N appearing exactly once, except for one number that is missing. How can you find the missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space? What if there were two numbers missing?

Hints:
#503: Start with the first part: Finding the missing number if only one number is missing.
#590: Part 1: If you have to find the missing number in O(1) space and O(N) time, then you can do a (sic) only constant number of passes through the array and can store only a few variables.
#609: Part 1: What if you added up all the values in the array? Could you then figure out the missing number?
#626: Part 2: We're now looking for two missing numbers, which we will call a and b. The approach from part 1 will tell us the sum of a and b, but it won't actually tell us a and b. What other calculations could we do?
#649: Part 2: There are a lot of different calculations we could try. For example, we could multiply all the numbers, but that will only lead us to the product of a and b.
#672: Part 2: Adding the numbers together will tell us the result of a + b. Multiplying the numbers together will tell us the result of a * b. How can we get the exact values for a and b?
#689: Part 2: We could do both. If we know that a + b = 87 and a * b = 962, then we can solve for a and b: a = 13 and b = 74. But this will also result in having to multiply really large numbers. The product of all the numbers could be larger than 10^157. Is there a simpler calculation you can make?
#696: Part 2: Almost any "equation" we can come up with will work here (as long as it's not equivalent to a linear sum). It's just a matter of keeping this sum small.
#702: Part 2: Try a sum of squares of the values.
#717: Part 2: You might need the quadratic formula. It's not a big deal if you don't remember it. Most people won't. Remember that there is such a thing as good enough.
