/*
You are building a diving board by placing a bunch of planks of wood end-to-end. There are two types of planks, one of length shorter and one of length longer. You must use exactly K planks of wood. Write a method to generate all possible lengths for the diving board. 

Hints:
#690: Consider building a diving board. What are the choices you make?
#700: Consider a recursive solution.
#715: Once you have a recursive algorithm, think about the runtime. Can you make this faster? How?
#722: Consider memoization to optimize the runtime. Think carefully about what exactly you cache. What is the runtime? The runtime is closely related to the max size of the table.
#740: There's an alternate, clever (and very fast) solution. You can actually do this in linear time without recursion. How?
#747: Think about it this way. You are picking K planks and there are two different types. All choices with 10 of the first type and 4 of the second type will have the same sum. Can you just iterate through all possible choices?
