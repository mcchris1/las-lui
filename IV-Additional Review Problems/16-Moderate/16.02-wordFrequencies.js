/*
Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?

Hints:
#489: Think about what the best conceivable runtime is for this problem. If your solution matches the best conceivable runtime, then you probably can't do any better.
#536: Can you use a hash table to optimize the repeated case?
