/*
Write a function to swap a number in place (that is, without temporary variables).

Hints:
#492: Try picturing the two numbers, a and b, on a number line.
#716: Let diff be the difference between a and b. Can you use diff in some way? Then can you get rid of this temporary variable?
#737: You could also try using XOR.
