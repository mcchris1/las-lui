/*
You have an integer matrix representing a plot of land, where the value at that location represents the height above sea level. A value of zero indicates water. A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The size of the pond is the total number of connected water cells. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in the matrix.

EXAMPLE
Input:  0 2 1 0
        0 1 0 1
        1 1 0 1
        0 1 0 1
Output: 2, 4, 1 (in any order)

Hints:
#674: If you were given the row and column of a water cell, how can you find all connected spaces?
#687: Try recursion to count the number of water cells.
#706: How can you make sure that you're not revisiting the same cells? Think about how breadth-first search or depth-first search on a graph works.
#723: You should be able to do this in O(NÂ³) time, where N is the length of one dimension of the square.
