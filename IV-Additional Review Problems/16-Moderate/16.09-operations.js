/*
Write methods to implement the multiply, subtract, and divide operations for integers. The results of all of these are integers. Use only the add operator. 

Hints:
#572: Approach these one by one, starting with subtraction. Once you've completed one function, you can use it to implement the others.
#600: Subtraction: Would a negate function (which converts a positive integer to negative) help? Can you implement this using the add operator?
#613: Multiply: it's easy enough to implement multiply using add. But how do you handle negative numbers?
#648: Divide: If you're trying to compute, where X = a/b, remember that a = bx. Can you find the closest value for x? Remember that this is integer division and x should be an integer.
