/*
On old cell phones, users typed on a numeric keypad and the phone would provide a list of words that matched these numbers. Each digit mapped to a set of 0 - 4 letters. Implement an algorithm to return a list of matching words, given a sequence of digits. You are provided a list of valid words (provided in whatever data structure you'd like). The mapping is shown in the diagram below:

|1 [   ] | 2 [abc]| 3 [def] |
|4 [ghi] | 5 [jkl]| 6 [mno] |
|7 [pqrs]| 8 [tuv]| 9 [wxyz]|
|   *    |    0   |    #    |

EXAMPLE
Input:  8733
Output: tree, used

Hints: #471, #487, #654, #703, #726, #744
