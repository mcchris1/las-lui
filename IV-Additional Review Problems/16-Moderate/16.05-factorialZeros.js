/*
Write an algorithm which computes the number of trailing zeros in n factorial.

Hints:
#585: How does a zero get into the result of n!? What does it mean?
#711: Each zero in n! corresponds to n being divisible by a factor of 10. What does that mean?
#729: Each factor of 10 in n! means n! is divisible by 5 and 2.
#733: Can you count the number of factors of 5 and 2? Do you need to count both?
#745: Have you considered that 25 actually accounts for two factors of 5?
