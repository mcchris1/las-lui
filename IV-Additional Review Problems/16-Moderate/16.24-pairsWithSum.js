/*
Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value.

Hints:
#548: Start with a brute force solution. What is the runtime? What is the best conceivable runtime for this problem?
#597: Can we make this faster with a hash table?
#644: What if the array were sorted?
#673: If we sorted the array, we could do repeated binary searches for the complement of a number. What if, instead, the array is given to us sorted? Could we then solve the problem in O(N) time and O(1) space?
