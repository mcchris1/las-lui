/*
You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.

EXAMPLE
Input:  2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10
Output: 5 (i.e., {3, -2, 4})

Hints:
#531: Picture the array as alternating sequences of positive and negative numbers. Observe that we would never include just part of a positive sequence or part of a negative sequence.
#551: Observe that if you have a sequence of values which have a negative sum, those will never start or end a sequence. (They could be present in a sequence if they connected two other sequences.)
#567: Start from the beginning of the array. As that subsequence gets larger, it stays as the best subsequence. Once it becomes negative, though, it's useless.
#594: If we tracked the running sum, we should reset it as soon as the subsequence becomes negative. We would never add a negative sequence to the beginning or end of another subsequence.
#614: You can solve this in O(N) time and O(1) space.
