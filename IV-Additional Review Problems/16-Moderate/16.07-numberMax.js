/*
Write a method that finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use if-else or any other comparison operator. 

Hints:
#473: Let k be 1 if a > b and 0 otherwise. If you were given k, could you return the max (without a comparison or if-else logic)?
#513: If k were 1 when a > b and 0 otherwise, then you could return a*k + b*(not k). But how do you create k?
#707: When a > b, then a - b > 0. Can you get the sign bit of a - b?
#728: Have you considered how to handle integer overflow in a - b?
