/*
Given two arrays of integers, find a pair of values (one value from each array) that you can swap to give the two arrays the same sum.

EXAMPLE
Input:  {4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2} and {3, 6, 3, 3}
Output: {1, 3}

Hints:
#545: Do some math here or play around with some examples. What does this pair need to look like? What can you say about their values?
#557: When you move a value a from array A to array B, then A's sum decreases by a and B's sum increases by a. What happens when you swap two values? What would be needed to swap two values and get the same sum?
#564: If you swap two values, a and b, then the sum of A becomes sumA - a + b and the sum of B becomes sumB - b + a. These sums need to be equal.
#571: You are looking for values a and b where sumA - a + b = sumB - b + a. Do the math to work out what this means for a and b's values.
#583: If we do the math, we are looking for a pair of values such that a - b = (sumA - sumB) / 2. The problem then reduces to looking for a pair of values with a particular difference.
#592: A brute force solution is to just look through all pairs of values to find one with the right difference. This will probably look like an outer loop through A with an inner loop through B. For each value, compute the difference and compare it to what we're looking for. Can we be more specific here, though? Given a value in A and a target difference, do we know the exact value of the element within B we're looking for?
#602: What the brute force really does is look for a value within B which equals a - target. How can you more quickly find this element? What approaches help us quickly find out if an element exists within an array?
#606: We can use a hash table here. We can also try sorting. Both help us locate elements more quickly.
#635: What if the sum of A is 11 and the sum of B is 8? Can there be a pair with the right difference? Check that your solution handles this situation appropriately.
