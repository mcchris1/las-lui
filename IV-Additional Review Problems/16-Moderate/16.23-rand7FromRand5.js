/*
Implement a method rand7() given rand5(). That is, given a method that generates a random number between 0 and 4 (inclusive), write a method that generates a random number between 0 and 6 (inclusive).

Hints:
#505: Be very careful that your solution actually returns each value from 0 through 6 with equal probability.
#574: Start with a brute force solution. How many times does it call rand5() in the worst case?
#637: Make a table indicating how each possible sequence of calls to rand5() would map to the result of rand7(). For example, if you were implementing rand3() with (rand2() + rand2()) % 3, then the table would look like the below. Analyze this table. What can it tell you?
    1st     2nd    Result
    0       0      0
    0       1      1
    1       0      1
    1       1      2
#668: Looking at this table again, note that the number of rows will be 5ᵏ, where k is the max number of calls to rand5(). In order to make each value between 0 and 6 have equal probability, 1/7th of the rows must map to 0, 1/7th to 1, and so on. Is this possible?
#697: It is not possible to divide 5ᵏ evenly by 7. Does this mean that you can't implement rand7() with rand5()?
#720: You can implement rand7() with rand5(), you just can't do it deterministically (such that you know it will definitely terminate after a certain number of calls). Given this, write a solution that works.
