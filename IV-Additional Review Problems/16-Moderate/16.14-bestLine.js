/*
Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.

Hints:
#491: Sometimes, a brute force is a pretty good solution. Can you try all possible lines?
#520: You can't truly try all possible lines in the world——that's infinite. But you know that a "best" line must intersect at least two points. Can you connect each pair of points? Can you check if each line is indeed the best line?
#529: You should be able to get to an O(N²) solution.
#563: Have you tried using a hash table?
