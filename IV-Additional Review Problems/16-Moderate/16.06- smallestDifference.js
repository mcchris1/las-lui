/*
Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.

EXAMPLE
Input:  {1, 3, 15, 11, 2}, {23, 127, 235, 19, 8}
Output: 3. That is, the pair (11, 8)

Hints:
#632: What if you sorted the arrays?
#670: Think about how you would merge two sorted arrays.
#679: Imagine you had the two arrays sorted and you were walking through them. If the pointer in the first array points to 3 and the pointer in the second array points to 9, what effect will moving the second pointer have on the difference of the pair?
