/*
Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).

Hints:
#107: Try modifying a graph search algorithm to track the depth from the root. 
#123: A hash table or array that maps from level number to nodes at that level might also be useful. 
#135: You should be able to come up with an algorithm involving both depth-first search and breadth-first search.
