/*
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

FOLLOW UP
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

Hints:
#9: Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to do this in a single pass of the linked list.
#40: Without extra space, you'll need O(NÂ²) time. Try using two pointers, where the second one searches ahead of the first one.
