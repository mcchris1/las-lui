/*
Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

Hints:
#5: A palindrome is something which is the same when written forwards and backwards. What if you reversed the linked list?
#13: Try using a stack.
#29: Assume you have the length of the linked list. Can you implement this recursively?
#61: In the recursive approach (we have the length of the list), the middle is the base case: isPermutation(middle) is true. The node x to the immediate left of the middle: What can that node do to check if x->middle->y forms a palindrome? Now suppose that checks out. What about the previous node a? If x->middle->y is a palindrome, how can it check that a->x->middle->y->b is a palindrome?
#101: Go back to the previous hint. Remember: There are ways to return multiple values. You can do this with a new class.
