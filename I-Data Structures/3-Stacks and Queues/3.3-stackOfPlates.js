/*
Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).

FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.

Hints:
#64: You will need to keep track of the size of each substack. When one stack is full, you may need to create a new stack.
#81: Popping an element at a specific substack will mean that some stacks aren't at full capacity. Is this an issue? There's no right answer, but you should think about how to handle this.
