How would you load test a webpage without using any test tools?

Hints:
#313: Think about what load testing is designed to test. What are the factors in the load of a webpage? What criteria would be used to judge if a webpage performs satisfactorily under heavy load?
#345: Could you build your own? What might that look like?
