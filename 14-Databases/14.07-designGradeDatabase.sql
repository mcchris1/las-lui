/*
Imagine a simple database storing information for students' grades. Design what this database might look like and provide a SQL query to return a list of the honor roll students (top 10%), sorted by their grade point average. 

Hints:
#428: You probably need a list of students, their courses, and another table building a relationship between students and courses. Note that this is a many-to-many relationship.
#442: Think carefully about how you handle ties when selecting the top 10%.
