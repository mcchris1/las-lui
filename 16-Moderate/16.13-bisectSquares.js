/*
Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis.

Hints:
#468: Draw a square and a bunch of lines that cut it in half. Where are those lines located?
#479: Any straight line that cuts a square in half goes through the center of the square. How then can you find a line that cuts two squares in half?
#528: To cut two squares in half, a line must go through the middle of both squares.
#560: Given a line (slope and y-intercept), can you find where it intersects another line?
