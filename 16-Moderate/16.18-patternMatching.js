/*
You are given two strings, pattern and value. The pattern string consists of just the letters a and b, describing a pattern whthin a string. For example, the string catcatgocatgo matches the pattern aabab (where cat is a and go is b). It also matches patterns like a, ab, and b. Write a method to determine if value matches pattern.

Hints:
#631: Start with a brute force approach. Can you try all possibilities for a and b?
#643: Observe that one of the substrings, either a or b, must start at the beginning of the string. That cuts down the number of possibilities.
#653: Don't forget to handle the possibility that the first character in the pattern is b.
#663: Be careful with how you analyze the runtime. If you iterate through O(n²) substrings and each one does an O(n) string comparison, then the total runtime is O(n³).
#685: Suppose you decide on a specific value for the "a" part of a pattern. How many possibilities are there for b?
#718: Since the value of a determines the value of b (and vice versa) and either a or b must start at the beginning of the value, you should have only O(n) possibilities for how to split up the pattern.
#727: You should be able to have an O(n²) algorithm.
