/*
Design and build a "least recently used" cache, which evicts the least recently used item. The cache should map from keys to values (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associated with a particular key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full, it should evict the least recently used item.

Hints:
#524: First scope the problem. What are the features you would want?
#630: What data structure would be most useful for the lookups? What data structure would be most useful to know and maintain the order of items?
#694: Both a hash table and a doubly linked list would be useful. Can you combine the two?
