/*
There is a class Country that has methods getContinent() and getPopulation(). Write a function int getPopulation(List<Country> countries, String continent) that computes the total population of a given continent, given a list of all countries and the name of a continent. 

Hints:
#448: Consider how you'd implement this first without lambda expressions.
#461: Break this up into two parts: filtering the countries and then getting a sum.
#464: Can you do this without a filter operation?
