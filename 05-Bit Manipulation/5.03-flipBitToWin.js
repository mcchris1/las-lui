/*
You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.

EXAMPLE
Input:  1775    (or: 11011101111)
Output: 8

Hints:
#159: Start with a brute force solution. Can you try all possibilities?
#226: Flipping a 0 to a 1 can merge two sequences of 1s——but only if the two sequences are separated by only one 0.
#314: Each sequence can be lengthened by merging it with an adjacent sequence (if any) or just flipping the immediate neighboring zero. You just need to find the best choice.
#352: Try to do it in linear time, a single pass, and O(1) space.
